Welcome to my slice of the internet! I’m Akash, a wanderer through the realms of Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and HCI, currently docking my curiosity at UC Davis as a PhD student under the guidance of [Prof. Setareh Rafatirad](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~srafatir/). My academic journey started oceans away as an undergrad at BITS Pilani in India, where I not only conquered coursework but also discovered my passions.

When I’m not decoding the complexities of ML algorithms or exploring the nuances of human-computer interaction, you can find me riding horses across scenic trails, sketching the world in graphite, or behind the camera scripting and directing short films. Each interest crafts a unique lens through which I see problems as puzzles waiting to be solved.

Dive into my portfolio to see where science meets creativity, where data meets storytelling, and where every line of code tells a story.
