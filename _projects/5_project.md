### üîπ Features & Applications
‚úÖ **Policy Text Processing:**  
   - Preprocesses policy documents using **coreference resolution, semantic role labeling, and topic modeling**.  
   - Handles large-scale policy text datasets with **Colab integration**.

‚úÖ **Institutional Grammar Parsing:**  
   - Implements **Elinor Ostrom's Institutional Grammar Framework** for extracting policy components.  
   - Performs **semantic clustering** of actors, resources, and activities.

‚úÖ **Policy Comparison & Evolution:**  
   - **Policy search engine** to compare institutional statements across communities.  
   - Analyzes **policy diffusion** over time using **semantic similarity models**.

‚úÖ **Scalable & Modular:**  
   - Uses **HuggingFace Transformers, Sentence-BERT, and BM25 retrieval** for efficient policy analysis.  
   - Supports **Google Colab GPU acceleration** for seamless processing.
